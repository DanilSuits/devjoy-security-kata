# Richard Dalton's Legacy Code Kata

This is a java port of the coding exercise proposed by Richard Dalton
in his blog post [Legacy Code Katas][1] (2013).

Starting from the implementation of the Security Manager presented here,
Dalton proposed the following goals

 * Break the dependency on the console
 * Get the password comparison feature under test
 * Get the password validation feature under test
 * Add a feature to allow different encryption algorithms to be used
